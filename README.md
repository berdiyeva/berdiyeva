### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal GitHub.

I'm Altyn, a software developer who enjoys building, learning, and experimenting with new technologies. This GitHub profile is where I keep my personal projects, random ideas, and learning experiments.

ðŸš¨ **Heads-up:** You won't find a ton of green squares here, not because I'm inactive, but because I currently contribute actively to my company's private GitLab repositories. Most of my recent work lives there!

This space is more of a playground for me, and I occasionally push things here when exploring something new or working on personal side-projects.

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜Š
